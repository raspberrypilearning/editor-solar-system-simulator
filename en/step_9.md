### Add another planet
Add a new planet so your model has **more than three**.

To add a planet to your model you will need to:

- Add code to load it in `load_planets()`
- Add code to draw its orbit in `draw_orbits()`
- Add code to draw the planet in `draw_planets()`
- Add code to notice when the planet is clicked, and print out its info in `mouse_pressed()`

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip" style="font-size: 1.1em">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t forget you can copy and paste code!
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Increase the size() in your setup() function to make the model large enough to see your new planets; size(900, 900) will fit them all in.

### Make up your own planet
Add an extra planet to the solar system! Create a new global variable with a dictionary for it. Then, add code to draw it and to print out its info.
